# Adapters
Adapters are your connections to LLM providers. We currently support Anthropic and OpenAI. It is very easy to add a new adapter by extending the base Adapter class. \
Adapter should ideally have a corresponding [template](Templates.qmd) to it since different LLMs have different formatting of prompts that they are best suited for. \
To use an adapter, you simply need to import an adapter of your choice.
```{python}
#| eval: false
from prompt_learner.adapters.openai import OpenAI
```
Running any inference requires an adapter as a paramter. The inference call is made through the specified LLM adapter.
```{python}
#| eval: false
classification_task.predict(OpenAI(), openai_prompt.prompt)
```
